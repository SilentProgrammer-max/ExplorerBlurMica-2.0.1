                    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    This version of the Lesser General Public License incorporates
    the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
    License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, and the “Library” refers to a covered work
  governed by this License.  A “work that uses the Library” means any
  work that contains code derived from the Library, or that links
  to the Library.  Such a work is called a “Combined Work” if it
  otherwise qualifies as an “Executable” under the terms of the GNU
  General Public License, and provided that it is not itself a
  library.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice, provided
  that you also meet the requirements of this License.  You must
  ensure that the Combined Work as a whole is at least as free as the
  Library.  In other words, you must license the Combined Work
  also under the GNU GPL, or remove any portions of the Combined Work
  that are not covered by this License before distributing.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  You may convey modifications of the Library under the terms of
  the GNU GPL, provided that you also do all of the following:

    a) Give prominent notice that you modified the files, including
       a relevant date.

    b) Cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
       that they are released under this License and any conditions
       added under section 7.

    c) Accompany the modified work with a machine-readable copy of
       the License.

3. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that
  permit modification of the Combined Work for the customer’s own
  use, but only if you also do each of the following:

    a) Give prominent notice that the Library is used in the Combined
       Work and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

    b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and a
       copy of the GNU LGPL (this License).

4. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are supplied with the
  Combined Work under a license of your choice, provided that you
  compensate for that by providing equivalent access to copy the
  source code of the Library portion under this License.

5. Minimal Corresponding Source.

  The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work include
  the source code for the portions of the Library included in the
  Combined Work, plus any associated interface definition files.

6. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the GNU LGPL from time to time.  You may always
  follow the terms and conditions of the version of the LGPL
  specified in the Combined Work, or (at your option) any later
  version published by the FSF.

                            END OF TERMS
